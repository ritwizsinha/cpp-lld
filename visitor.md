## Pattern Description

The Visitor pattern implementation consists of the following components:

### Abstract Classes
1. **Visitor**
   - Defines the interface for visiting different elements
   - Declares visit methods for each concrete element type
   - Pure virtual methods ensure implementation in concrete visitors

2. **Element**
   - Declares the accept operation that takes a visitor
   - Enables double dispatch mechanism

### Concrete Classes
1. **Class A and B** (Concrete Elements)
   - Inherit from Element
   - Implement accept() method
   - Provide specific data through getDataA() and getDataB()

2. **ConcreteVisitor**
   - Implements the Visitor interface
   - Defines specific behavior for visiting each element type
   - Processes element-specific data

### Relationships
- **Inheritance** (solid lines with hollow arrows):
  - A and B inherit from Element
  - ConcreteVisitor inherits from Visitor

- **Dependencies** (dotted lines):
  - Elements use Visitor through accept() method
  - ConcreteVisitor depends on concrete elements to access their data

This pattern allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures, following the Open-Closed Principle.
